## Introduction
-->This exercise covers how one can pass the SAMLResponse from one Service Provider to another Service Provider.
-->This course details the exploitation of an insecure SAML implementation that allows attackers to log in to a service provider despite the identity provider (IDP) trying to prevent it. The issue comes from the fact that the service provider does not check the claim when receiving the SAMLResponse and will trust a claim issued for another service provider.

## The attack
-->Since the Service Provider #2 does not check the claim, we will need to get a claim issued for the Service Provider #1 and pass it to Service Provider #2.
-->To get a valid claim, we will need to tamper with the SAMLRequest from the Service Provider #1 and change the value of the ServiceURL.
-->To decode the SAMLRequest, you will need to use URL-decoding, base64 decoding and Inflate.
-->To re-encode the SAMLRequest, you will need to use Deflate, base64 encoding, URL-encoding.

## Conclusion
-->This exercise showed you how to get the Identity Provider to generate a SAMLResponse that you can pass to a Service Provider that does not check the claim in it. With more and more enterprises using SSO, it is essential to ensure that this kind of mistakes gets detected and fixed before they get exploited.
