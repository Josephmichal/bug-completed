## Introduction
-->This course details the exploitation of an insecure SAML implementation that allows a malicious user to become another user by getting the Identity Provider (IDP) to create an assertion that will be parsed differently by the provider. This challenge was inspired by the following article [Duo Finds SAML Vulnerabilities Affecting Multiple Implementations](https://duo.com/blog/duo-finds-saml-vulnerabilities-affecting-multiple-implementations).

## The attack
-->One of the common issues with protocols relying on signatures to prevent tampering comes from the fact that the signed data is parsed differently by the system receiving it. Here we are going to create a malicious email address to become the user admin@libcurl.so for the service provider. The issue here is that the Service Provider will stripe XML comments from the email address provided in the SAMLResponse by the IDP
-->To exploit this issue, you will need to:
-   Register an account on the IDP that will end up as admin@libcurl.so once comments are stripped
-   Login via SAML from the Service Provider

## Conclusion
-->This exercise showed you how to exploit a vulnerability in a SAML implementation impacting the Service Provider. With more and more enterprises using SSO, it is essential to ensure that this kind of mistakes gets detected and fixed before they get exploited.

## The attack
- Register as a user like `admin<!--comment-->@libcurl.so` on the IDP
- start the SAML authentication
