## Introduction
-->This exercise covers the exploitation of a vulnerability similar to the recent CVE-2017-17405 impacting Ruby Net::FTP
-->This exercise is very similar to JWT III and was inspired by the recent vulnerability in the Ruby library Net::FTP ([CVE-2017-17405](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/14/net-ftp-command-injection-cve-2017-17405/)).

## The vulnerability
-->The bug impacting the Net::FTP library, as well as this application lies in the difference between a call to:
```
File.open(....)
```
and:
```
open(...)
```
-->While the former allows an attacker with control over the first argument to read arbitrary files, the latter allows you to run command (by using a | before the command):
```
 irb
	irb(main):001:0> File.open("|/usr/bin/uname").read()
	Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - |/usr/bin/uname
	  from (irb):1:in `initialize'
	  from (irb):1:in `open'
	  from (irb):1
	  from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
	irb(main):002:0> open("|/usr/bin/uname").read()
	=> "Darwin\n"
```
-->Using the same injection point as JWT III, you should be able to gain code execution to run the score command.
-->Since the signature is checked after the vulnerability is exploited, you don't need to provide a valid signature in this exercise.

## Conclusion
-->This exercise showed you how to exploit a call to open in Ruby.
-->Here by finding a vulnerability in the way the key was retrieved, you were able to gain code execution.

# Video Explanation
## Video 1 - introduction
-->ivide header il "key id" enna paramter und.this is often used to retrieve a key from :
- database
- filesysytem
-->this is done prior to the verification of the signature if the paramter is injectable,you can bypass the signature
-->in this challenge the injection is a remote command execution
-->the injection will allow you to gain command execution before the token is verified
-->Ruby has to ways to open files :
- FIle.open
- Kernal.open or open
-->kernal.open/open  will run the filename as a command if the filename starts with a pipe | :
`"|touch /tmp/test"`
