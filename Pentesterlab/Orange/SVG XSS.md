## Introduction
-->This course details how an attacker can upload a malicious SVG file to get Cross-Site Scripting on a website.

## Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
-->SVG images are XML files used to describe an image:
```xml
<svg width="500" height="500">
	<text x="0" y="15" fill="red">A black rectangle:</text>
	<rect width="300" height="20" style="fill:rgb(0,0,0);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" x="100" y="0" />
</svg>
```
-->They are mostly used as they are scalable and often take less bandwidth than the same image in JPG/PNG/GIF format. However, not all images can be described as vectors.
-->As an attacker, the good thing provided by SVG is the ability to include JavaScript in the image:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
	<script type="text/javascript">
		alert(1);
	</script>
</svg>
```

## The attack
-->To solve this challenge, you will need to carefully look at the upload functionality and how the file extension and the `content-type` values are used as part of the upload and when the file is served. Using this, you should be able to upload a malicious file and get it served as SVG. Once you can trigger the XSS against yourself, you can visit the main website to get the victim to visit your malicious link and mark this challenge as solved.

## Conclusion
-->This exercise explained how to get Cross-Site Scripting by uploading a malicious SVG. Upload functionalities too often bring code execution but it is also good to know how to check for other issues when remote code execution is not available.
