## Introduction
-->This exercise covers how insecure calls to the JavaScript function postMessage() can be used to leak sensitive information when a listener does not filter the origin
-->This course details the exploitation of an application using addEventListener() and not verifying the origin of the message. Using this issue you will be able to get an administrator to leak confidential information to you via the "Sharing" functionality. This challenge is based on the following content: [postMessage issues](https://github.com/EdOverflow/bugbountywiki/wiki/postMessage-issues) and [The pitfalls of postMessage](https://labs.detectify.com/2016/12/08/the-pitfalls-of-postmessage/).

## Exploitation of the vulnerability
-->To exploit this issue, you will need to create a malicious HTML page that will open the vulnerable page in an iframe and postMessage to the iframe.
-->The structure of your exploit should look something like this:
```html
	<html>
	<body>
	<iframe id="myiframe" src="http://[VULNERABLE_SITE]/"></iframe>
	<script>
	// Call to postMessage using a reference to myiframe
	</script>
	</body>
	</html>
```

## Conclusion
-->This exercise showed you a way to exploit a page that uses addEventListener without restriction on the origin. This allowed opening the page as the legitimate application would and use postMessage() to trigger unexpected behaviors.
