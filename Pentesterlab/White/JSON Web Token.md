## Introduction
-->This course details the exploitation of a weakness in JSON Web Token (JWT).
-->In this application, JWT is used for authentication.Upon successful login, the user is issued a JWT in a cookie.
-->JSON Web Tokens are a storage mechanism for data. JWT can provide the following security mechanisms:
-   Encryption.
-   Signature.
-->JWT follow the following pattern :
`Base64(Header).Base64(Data).Base64(Signature)`

## The vulnerability
-->This issue was originally discussed in the following blog post: https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/.
-->In this article, Tim McLean discussed multiple issues in the signature mechanism used by JWT. In this exercise, we are going to focus on the first issue.
-->Multiple signature methods can be used to ensure the integrity of JWT :
-   RSA based
-   Elliptic curves
-   HMAC
-   None
-->Like SSL (with the NULL Cipher), JWT support a None algorithm for signature.
-->This was probably introduced to debug applications. However, this can have a severe impact on the security of the application.

## Exploitation
-->To exploit this vulnerability, you just need to decode the JWT and change the algorithm used for the signature, then you can submit your new JWT.
-->However, this won't work unless you remove the signature.
-->If you think like a developer, it actually makes a lot of sense.
-->If you had to develop a JWT library, you would start by generating all the signatures you need to support, as that allows you to compare your implementation to others.
-->Then you would create a generic verification method to compare what you get from the JWT with the signature you are generating (based on the algorithm in the header).
-->Since you don't generate any signature with the None algorithm, you will ensure that the signature is empty.
-->Therefore, as an attacker, you need to provide an empty signature.

## Conclusion
-->This exercise showed you how you can tamper with a JWT to gain administrator access in an application.
-->It showed you that having a signed value is only as strong as the weakest algorithm used if an attacker can pick what algorithm is used.
