## Introduction
-->This challenge covers the impact of nonce reuse on GCM
-->This exercise covers the impact of reusing the same nonce (IV) when encrypting data using Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). The same attack works again Counter mode (CTR).

## Exploitation
-->To exploit this issue, you will need to register an account and post a message. Then by using XOR, you should be able to retrieve the key for this challenge.
