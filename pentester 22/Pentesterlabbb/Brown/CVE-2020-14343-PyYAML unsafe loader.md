## Introduction
-->This exercise covers how you can gain code execution when an application use a vulnerable version of PyYAML and relies on load()
-->This course details the exploitation of the vulnerability CVE-2020-14343. This vulnerability covers a vulnerability in PyYAML that can be used to gain code execution. The issue was initially published in the following post: [Showcasing the Importance of Secure Defaults with a PyYAML 0day](https://blog.ankursundara.com/pyyaml-cve/).

## The vulnerability
-->The vulnerability comes from a change in the way `YAML.load()` in Python works and how the library authors moved from `safe_load()` to `load()` with a restriction on the class loader.

## Exploitation
-->To exploit this issue, you will need to build a YAML message that will allow you to gain code execution. This can be done by using the details in the original post. You can also write a simpler payload than the one provided by looking at the exploit you used in the [Code Execution 07](https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/codexec_07/course) challenge in the [Essential Badge](https://pentesterlab.com/badges/essential).

## Conclusion
-->This exercise showed you how to exploit CVE-2020-14344 to gain code execution on a server by forging your own exploit. I hope you enjoyed learning with PentesterLab.
