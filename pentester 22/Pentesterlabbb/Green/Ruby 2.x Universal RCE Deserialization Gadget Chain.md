## Introduction
-->This exercise covers how to get code execution by using a Ruby Universal Gadget when an attacker controls the data passed to Marshal.load()
-->This exercise covers the [research done](https://www.elttam.com.au/blog/ruby-deserialization/) by [Luke Jahnke](https://twitter.com/bitcoinctf) on Ruby deserialization. Before this article, you had to either:
-   rely on the availability of some Rails library.
-   find your own gadget in the libraries used.
-->Luke discovered and published a way to gain code execution that doesn't rely on any external library and allow to gain code execution as long as you control the data in a call to Marshal.load(...)

## Exploitation
-->The exploitation relies on a set of gadget that ends calling the method Kernel.open(...). To generate the proper gadget, you just need to modify the script provided in the [article](https://www.elttam.com.au/blog/ruby-deserialization/) and change the command.

## Conclusion
-->This short exercise allowed you to look into the world of Ruby deserialization and have a test bed to make sure you have everything ready to exploit this issue before coming across it during a real test.
