## Introduction
-->This exercise details the exploitation of a Cross-Site Request Forgery to gain access to sensitive data
-->The introduction of `SameSite` in browsers may limit the exploitation of this issue. The victim uses an old browser that does not enforce `SameSite=Lax`.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery
-->When a browser visits a website, it will automatically send its cookies for this website.
```r
For example, when you load an image from website B when visiting website A, your browser will automatically send your cookies for website B to website B and your cookies for website A to website A.
```
-->This behaviour may allow you to trick users to perform unwanted actions in a website.
-->The most common fictitious example is a website that allows users to change their password by visiting http://example/change_password?new=Password123.
-->This can be used by a malicious website, to get users to change their password on the `example` site by loading an image:
```html	
	<html>
	...
	<img src="http://example/change_password?new=Password123" /> 
	...
	</html>
```
-->By loading this page, the victim will change their password without realising it.
-->For a POST request, it's a bit more complex as you will need to create a malicious form that will be auto-submitted when the page is loaded:
```html
	<html>
	<body onload=document.getElementById('csrf').submit()>
	<form id="csrf" action="http://example/change_password" method="POST">
	<input name='password' type='password' value="Password123">
	</form>
	</body>
	</html>
```

## Detection of Cross-Site Request Forgery
-->In order to detect a CSRF, you need to search for potentially dangerous methods that are completely predictable.
-->This comes from the fact that most protections against CSRF rely on adding a nonce (big unique number) to forms as a `hidden` field:
```html
	<form action="/something_dangerous" method="POST">
	<input name='csrf' type='hidden' value="d90f66d31b23c9998f8a2fcc1339481b">
	...
	</form>
```

## Exploitation
-->To exploit the issue in this challenge, you can use the auto-submitted form above, and use it to make the dangerous change in the application.
-->You will then need to host this page on a public IP address, and get the victim to visit your malicious site.

## Conclusion
-->This exercise showed you a way to exploit a simple Cross-Site Request Forgery to manage to get an administrator to perform unwanted actions.
-->It's a simple introduction, but it helps us establish some foundational understanding required for the following exercises on CSRF.
