## Getting the Android application
-->In this challenge, you can download the Android application using the following link: [Android02.apk](https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/android_02/attachments/0)

## This challenge
-->The application requires a pin code to give you the key. However, no pin code is set, so you will not be able to retrieve the key.
-->The way to solve this exercise is to extract the contents of the apk (using [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)) for example) to get the configuration files of the application. Once you manage to extract the apk, you will find multiple files. It's always important to check for file ending in .db or .sqlite to see what information is shipped with the application. By reviewing these files, you should be able to find the key to solve this exercise.
