## Getting the Android application
-->In this challenge, you can download the Android application using the following link: [Android01.apk](https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/android_01/attachments/0)

## This challenge
-->The application requires a pin code to give you the key. However, no pin code is set, so you will not be able to retrieve the key.
-->The way to solve this exercise is to extract the content of the apk (using [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)) for example) to get the configuration files of the application. Once you manage to extract the apk, you should check the content of the following files:

-   AndroidManifest.xml: this is the main configuration file used by all Android applications. It is used by Android to get information about the application as well as what functionalities are exposed to other applications (amongst other things).
-   res/values/strings.xml

-->apktool allows you to unzip the apk file and also decode files like AndroidManifest.xml to make it easier to review them.
-->By inspecting these files, you will be able to get the key to score this exercise.
